🚀 Guestara – Menu & Pricing Engine (Backend)

This project is a backend system for managing menus, services, and bookings with real-world pricing logic.
Instead of storing a fixed final price in the database, the system calculates prices dynamically at runtime based on business rules.

The main goal of this project was to focus on engineering thinking, not just CRUD APIs.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Node.js & Express – Backend framework

MongoDB & Mongoose – Database and ODM

Joi – Request validation

Swagger (OpenAPI) – API documentation

Layered Architecture – Clean separation of responsibilities

🏗️ Overall Architecture

The project follows a layered architecture to keep the code clean and maintainable.

src/
├── models/        # Database schemas (MongoDB)
├── controllers/   # Handle requests & responses
├── routes/        # API routes
├── services/      # Core business logic (pricing, tax)
├── validations/   # Joi validation schemas
├── config/        # Swagger and app configs
├── app.js         # Express app setup
├── server.js      # Server startup & DB connection

Why this structure?

Controllers stay thin and readable

Business logic lives in services

Validation happens before data reaches the database

New features can be added without breaking existing code

📊 Data Modeling Decisions
Category

Stores tax configuration

Uses is_active for soft deletes

Item

Belongs to a category

Supports exactly one pricing type

Can optionally support:

Add-ons

Booking availability

Booking

Stored in a separate collection

Tracks actual slot reservations instead of rules

This separation helps avoid data duplication and keeps the system scalable.

💰 Pricing Engine (Core Feature)

The pricing engine calculates prices every time the API is called instead of storing a final price.

Supported Pricing Types

Static Pricing – Fixed price

Complimentary Pricing – Always free

Discounted Pricing – Flat or percentage discount

Tiered Pricing – Price based on usage duration

All pricing logic is handled inside:

services/pricing.service.js

Tiered Pricing Example
Up to 1 hour → ₹300  
Up to 2 hours → ₹500  


If a user requests 1.5 hours, the system automatically selects the ₹500 tier.

🧾 Tax Inheritance

Tax is not stored at the item level.

How it works:

Items inherit tax from their category

Tax is applied dynamically during price calculation

Why this approach?

If tax rules change, updating one category automatically updates pricing for all related items — without touching item records.

🧩 Add-ons System

Items can define add-ons such as:

Extra cheese

Olives

Packaging (mandatory)

Rules:

Mandatory add-ons are always included

Optional add-ons are included only when selected

Add-ons are added before tax calculation

This mirrors how real restaurant pricing works.

📅 Availability & Booking System

Items can optionally be marked as bookable.

Each bookable item defines:

Available days (e.g. Mon–Fri)

Fixed time slots (e.g. 10:00–11:00)

Available Slots API
GET /bookings/:itemId/slots?date=YYYY-MM-DD


This API:

Reads all possible slots from the item

Removes already booked slots

Returns only free slots

Booking API
POST /bookings/:itemId/book


Before creating a booking, the system checks for an existing booking with the same:

Item

Date

Time slot

This prevents double booking.

🔍 Price Calculation API
GET /items/:id/price


Returns:

Base price

Discount

Add-ons total

Tax

Final payable price

This ensures all business rules are applied consistently.

🗑️ Soft Delete Strategy

Records are never permanently deleted.

Uses is_active = false

Keeps historical data intact

Matches real production systems

🤔 Trade-offs & Simplifications

Due to time constraints, some features were intentionally simplified or deferred:

Add-on groups (choose 1 of many)

Time-based dynamic pricing windows

Advanced booking overlap logic

The architecture is designed so these can be added later without major refactoring.

🧠 Written Reflections
Why did you choose MongoDB?

MongoDB provides flexibility for evolving schemas, which was useful for handling different pricing types, add-ons, and booking structures.

Three things I learned

Designing pricing as runtime logic instead of static data

Importance of separating business logic from controllers

Validating APIs early using Joi to avoid bad data

Hardest challenge

Designing the pricing engine to handle multiple pricing strategies cleanly without mixing logic.

What I would improve with more time

Add automated tests

Improve booking overlap handling

Implement advanced add-on groups

🙌 Final Note

This project focuses on clean architecture, correct business logic, and real-world backend design, rather than just implementing CRUD operations.
